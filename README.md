# Ava WhatsApp Agent Extended

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

> **Honorable Mention**: This project is based on [Ava WhatsApp Agent Course](https://github.com/neural-maze/ava-whatsapp-agent-course) by Neural Maze. We've extended it with additional features like multi-provider support for image generation and analysis.

Ava is a versatile AI companion agent that can interact through chat, generate images, and convert speech to text and back. This project is built on a flexible architecture that supports multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, Together AI, and ElevenLabs.

## Features

- üí¨ **Natural Conversation**: Have natural, context-aware conversations with your AI companion
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Generation**: Generate images based on your descriptions, with support for Together AI or OpenAI DALL-E
- üîç **Image Analysis**: Analyze images with detailed descriptions using Groq or OpenAI
- üó£Ô∏è **Voice Interaction**: Talk to your AI with text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT)
- üß† **Memory System**: Both short-term and long-term memory with vector database support
- üîÑ **Multi-Provider Support**: Switch between different LLM providers (OpenAI, Groq, Ollama)
- üì± **WhatsApp Integration**: Chat with your AI companion directly through WhatsApp
- üíª **Web Interface**: Interact through a browser-based Chainlit interface
